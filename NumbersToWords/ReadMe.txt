Notes regarding my work:

1. Thank you for reviewing this!
2. I decided that making an extension method for the Decimal struct would be a decent way to go.
3. I was told to worry more about structure and demonstrating integration of unit testing, rather than total completeness.
4. This performs up to the billions.  I will never see a check that high, so I didn't wish to depress myself further by going into the trillions.

Regards and take care!
